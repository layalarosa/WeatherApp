# WeatherApp This project uses the Maui platform to create an application that consumes an external API to get weather information. 
The API provides up-to-date data on temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and other relevant meteorological factors for a specific location. 
The Maui app uses this information to provide a friendly and visually appealing user experience for users, 
who can view real-time weather information on their mobile or desktop devices. 
This solution is useful for those who want to be informed about the weather and how it can affect their daily activities.
